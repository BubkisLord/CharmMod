# Fyrenest - A mod that adds over 20 new charms!
This mod IS COMPATIBLE with ItemChanger, Transcendance, Benchwarp, Randomizer and more!
Currently, you cannot pick up charms via randomizer,
but you can gain them when you get the requirements through randomizer.
eg. you get shadow dash from a rancid egg. Now u also have Powerful Dash.

## -- WHAT THE CHARMS DO --
Quickfall -> Fall faster

Slowfall -> Fall slower

Ravenous Soul -> Get heaps of soul per hit, but take double dmg

Powerful Dash -> Makes your dash faster and go further. Use with dashmaster and sharp shadow. (by itself, sharp shadow makes it go further than dashmaster does by itself.)

Sturdy Nail -> *Doubles* nail damage

Hunter's Mark -> Unlocks ALL journal entries and info

Hungry Soul -> Get lots of soul per hit

Slow Soul -> Get +4 to max health, but go really slow. use with speedtime, speed soul or other charm like that

Enraged Crystal Dash -> Makes crystal dash do 50 damage and go x6 speed

Hollow Knight's Blessing -> makes lifeblood charms better. (including joni's blessing)

Healthy Shell -> gives you 1 mask periodically (but takes 11 soul to balance). if ur at full health, gives u soul.

Glass Cannon -> You die in 1 hit, but one-shot everything. (nail damage is set to 6000)

Wealthy Amulet -> gives 10 geo per hit, but costs 100 geo to heal. can be used with sly deal

Opportunistic Defeat -> Get geo and soul when hit.

Spell Soul -> Makes spells BIG. (can be used with shaman stone, for even more destructive results. (don't wear with shaman amp from transcendance bc it is not tested and may go bad..))

Slowtime -> Slows down time. (self explanatory)

Speedtime -> Speeds up time. (self explanatory)

Soul Switch -> Takes health periodically, and gives u soul back. (for spell based builds)

Geo Switch -> Takes health periodically, and gives u geo back. (ur gonna have a lot of geo if u pair this with healthy shell)

Speed Soul -> You move at x3 speed when equipped, but u lose 1 charge of soul periodically. (pair with soul switch and healthy shell for interesting results...)
