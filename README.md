CharmMod - A mod that adds over 20 new charms!
Currently, you cannot pick up charms via randomizer,
but you can gain them when you get the requirements through randomizer.
eg. you get shadow dash from a rancid egg. Now u also have Powerful Dash

THIS MOD IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME MODS LIKE ITEMCHANGER OR TRANSCENDANCE. (maybe benchwarp and others too. experiment, idk what exactly)
YOU WILL KNOW IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE IF YOUR TITLE SCREEN IS JUST A TITLE AND HAS NO BUTTONS.
IK THIS IS A PROBLEM. AND I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG.
(but is compatible with More Healing mod (adds more healing charms.))
