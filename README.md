# Fyrenest - A mod that adds over 20 new charms!
This mod is now compatible with Transcendance, Benchwarp, Randomizer and more!
Currently, you cannot pick up charms via randomizer,
but you can gain them when you get the requirements through the randomizer.
For example, this means that if you get shadow dash from a randomized pickup,
you will gain powerful dash.

## WHAT THE CHARMS DO
Better Crystal Dash:
- Increases speed of crystal dash
- Makes it do more damage

Blue Blood:
- Makes lifeblood able to be regenerated

Bulbous Infection:
- Supposedly enlarges and slows enemies
- Doesn't work

Elder Stone:
- Makes you walk slow
- Makes you fall slow
- Blocks all damage 3/4 times
